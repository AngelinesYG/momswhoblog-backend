      blog:`Having all boys, while it’s an incredible blessing, it’s also A LOT of work. These kids just won’t’ sit the heck down!!
      I can’t keep up with them. You turn your back for one second and it’s like a damn tornado struck the place.
      Yes, they are super sweet and always wanting to hug you. Words can’t express the love…
      But I’m tired of having to strip naked from the waist down just so I could pee due to the fear of getting up from the toilet and having the bottom of my pants soaked in piss. And that’s not the worse part, I can’t even count how many times I almost busted my ass trying to sit down on the toilet only to notice, at the very last minute, that the seat is bathed in the sticky, stinky, disgusting, yellow liquid. Ugh!

      And no. It doesn’t really get better. The older the messier! I can’t tell you how many times I found nasty, moldy, old, dried-up food on some random place in a plate I had been looking for for days. Sigh…

      But you know what even more insane?! Incomprehensible even. The fear of some hoochie, chicken head coming to take my babies away. Because no matter how much they annoy me and piss me off, they’re my babies. I wouldn’t change them for the world; and no women will ever be good enough for them.

      If they could only just learn to freaking piss INSIDE the damn toilet!`,

      blog: `Being a mom brings me so much joy. My son puts a smile on my face everytime I look at him. However, that doesn’t mean I don’t have days that are overwhelming. Sometimes I feel there aren’t enough hours in the day for me to complete all my task. As a working mom it feels as if I have two jobs. It feels as if I clock of one and then immediately clock in to the next one.

      Imagine a baby crying because he wants to be held and your food is on the stove and if you don’t tend to it dinner will be ruined leaving you with double the work but you don’t want to leave your baby crying. That’s just one scenario of the million I come across as a mother . Being a working mom means I have less time for chores, spending time with my baby, school work, and personal life. As a new mom
      I don’t want anyone thinking I can’t take care of my child so it’s challenging because it makes me never want to ask or accept help.

      There isn’t a cookie cutter way to parent and manage my day to day life. I wake up everyday and tackle that day the best I can that given day.

      I’d say some days I feel like superwoman and other days I feel like I need to do better. `,

      blog: `Today work was so hectic and the fiscal year is coming to an end. We still do not have our budget set, which has me stressed out. So while I was trying to catch up with work before my next meeting. My son calls me, telling me that his computer is not longer working and he won’t be able to participate in school.

      It’s so difficult being a single parent that has a demanding full-time job and is going to school. Like sometimes I wish I had a double so I can tap out from time to time. My head is full of thoughts and tasks that I need to complete, so much going on that it’s sometimes hard to unwind. From the spreadsheet in my head, to clinic events, so my 9 year-old's needs. I’m just so spent...`,

      blog: `Everyone knows parenting is hard. Kids should really come with an instruction manual or something. Or at least a warning.

      Don't get me wrong. I love my kids and everything I do is for them. But when you have to juggle between being a mom, a housewife, a student, and managing everything else, there's really no room for anything else. Not even 'me' time.

      This remote learning environment has made it especially hard on all of us, but I'd have to say working moms the most. On top of everything else we were doing before, now we have to be teachers too. I mean, I'd chose the safety of my child over a virus infected school any day, but that doesn't mean it isn't hard to handle all of the demands we are still expected to handle as if the kids were still in school. Most employers still hold women to the same or higher standards without understanding the extreme hardships of the current circumstances.

      Seriously ladies, how do you attend your meetings or are able to focus in class when your kids is sitting right next to you pulling at your shirt and calling you mommy for the thousand time? How do you get any work done? I find it now takes me tripple the time to complete any tasks. Doing homework while you have a baby trying to climb on top of you, your four-year-old asking for an extra snack or anthing else he can think of, and your six-year-old runnin a tornado next to you while your teenager is screaming at him to stop. It's impossible! How us moms get any work done is beyond me. I don't even know how I do it half the time. I guess it's like my teenager says; we moms have super powers and arent' human.

      To all you working/student moms out there. Power to you!
      We got this!`,

      blog: `I’ve been fortunate to be able to be a stay at home mom to my kids as they go through their formative years.

      My husband and I have made conscious sacrifices financially and emotionally to be able to support this decision. This is not to say that being a working mom is any less a sacrifice.  I have high respect and applaud working moms for their determination and their willingness to take on both responsibilities.

      As a stay at home mom of children who are getting older,  I’ve been struggling to find my own place in the world. Who am I besides their mom? When I really try to narrow in this question and dig deep, I hit road blocks where I’m feeling so low and my self esteem becomes shattered. Those moments hit especially hard when my kids (ages 5, 10, 14) have their low moments and they are going through phases of tantrums, attitudes or back talk. I know deep down these are normal childhood behaviors; however, I can’t help but to be my own worst critic and question my parenting skills as their full time mom and caregiver.

      I also have really high moments when in search of my purpose and self worth, I remind my self of how beautiful it is to bring life into this world and how special it is to be able to nurture them with my everything, to help them become someone the world needs.  My question would be how do I maintain this positive mindset though my kids lowest moments? Because truth be told, these low moments are a part of life.

      As our children grow into adulthood there will be obstacles, there will be high moments and low moments and moments of joy and moments of despair. How do I stop blaming myself for their lowest moments and accept that life will always be filled with ups and downs for them?`,

      blog: `I am trully blessed to have a child that loves me unconditionally, despite my faults and inperfections. I am a stronger woman because of my daughter.

      But being a mom is no ease task. Every things concerning your child’s needs falls on you, especially when you are a single mom. It is no longer about you and whatever your needs or wants are, they must now be pushed aside because your child's everything comes first. It really takes a toll on you financially, emotionally, spiritually, etc
      Makes you a stronger individual

      Not only that, but your child's feelings as well become your own. Your child's worries become your own. You now feel guilty because you think you child feels incomplete because of the absent father, when in reality, by leaving, you were protecting her from someone who mistreated both of us and doesn't deserver her.

      Due to those experiences and traumas, now dating becomes a huge challenge because now as a single mom you now have to think about whether or not the  person you are considereing is even a good fit for my child. It's not even about whether you like the person or not, that doesn't even matter as much. All that matters is will this person love my child and treat them as I would. I mean, lets face it. Dating for us single moms is practically over...

      Your whole world revolves around your kid now. Every single descion I make now will forever affect my daughter. Being a mom forces you to grow up and become selfless, stronger, wiser. While it a huge challenge and I often question my abilities, I can't deny that it has been a blessing.`,
